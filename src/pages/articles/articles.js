        text:`Welcome to the new website. I am extremely excited to share with 
        you what I've been working on. This is the blog portion of the website,
        where I am able to share some stories and articles with you all. <br/><br/>
        
        In all honesty, I asm super excited that I get to create this website using
        one of the most powerful web technologies, Next.JS. This article won't get into
        the specifics of all the features used. But because of the technologies Next
        allows me to work with are so unique to different frameworks like React or plain
        old html, I am able to simplify the structure of this website, writing less code
        and allowing me to focus on more interesting, innovative, aspects of the website.
